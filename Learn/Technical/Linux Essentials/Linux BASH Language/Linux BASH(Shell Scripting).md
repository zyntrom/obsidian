# Bash Scripting Full Guide

---

## 1.  What is Bash?

- Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and scripting language.
- Used for: automation, file management, system control.

---

## 2. Basic Structure of a Bash Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash      # Shebang: defines the interpreter 
# This is a comment  
echo "Hello, World"   # Print to terminal
```

### Making a Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x script.sh    # Make script executable 
./script.sh           # Run the script
```

---

## 3. Variables

```bash
name="ZynTrom" 
echo "Hello $name"         # Use variable 
echo "Hello ${name}"       # Safe syntax
```

### Arithmetic

```bash
a=5 
b=3 
echo $((a + b))     # 8 
((a++))             # increment 
let "c = a * b"     # using let
```

---

## 4. Input / Output

```bash
read name 
echo "You entered: $name"  
read -p "Enter your age: " age
```

---

## 5. Conditionals

```bash
if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then     
	echo "Adult" 
elif [ $age -gt 12 ]; then     
	echo "Teen" 
else     
echo "Child" 
fi
```

### Comparison Operators

#### Numbers

- `-eq` (equal), `-ne` (not equal)
- `-lt` (less), `-le` (less or equal)
- `-gt` (greater), `-ge` (greater or equal)

#### Strings

- = (equal), != (not equal)
- `-z` (empty), `-n` (not empty)

#### Files

- `-e` (exists), `-f` (regular file), `-d` (directory)
- `-r`, `-w`, `-x` (read/write/execute permission)

## 6. Loops

### For Loop

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do     
	echo $i done
```

### C-style For Loop

```bash
for ((i = 0; i < 5; i++)); do     
	echo $i done
```

### While Loop

```bash
count=1 
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do     
	echo $count     
	((count++)) 
done
```

### Until Loop

```bash
count=1 
until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do     
	echo $count     
	((count++)) 
done
```

---

## 7. Functions

```bash
greet() {     
	echo "Hello, $1" }  
greet "ZynTrom"
```

---

## 8. File Handling

### Write and Append

```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt       
# Overwrite 
echo "Another line" >> file.txt  # Append
```

### Read Line-by-Line

```bash
while read line; do     
	echo "$line" 
done 
< file.txt
```

### Check File

```bash
if [ -f file.txt ]; then     
	echo "Exists and is a file" 
fi
```

---

## 9. Command Line Arguments

```bash
echo "Script name: $0" 
echo "1st arg: $1" 
echo "2nd arg: $2" 
echo "All args: $@" 
echo "Arg count: $#"
```

Run:

```bash
./myscript.sh hello world
```

---

## 10. Error Handling

```bash
command || echo "Failed" 
command && echo "Succeeded"  
set -e     # Exit on first error set -u     # Exit if using undefined variables
```

---

## 11. String Operations


```bash
str="Hello World" 
echo "${str:0:5}"       # Substring 
echo "${#str}"          # Length 
echo "${str/World/Unix}" # Replace
```

---

## 12. Timing and Sleep

```bash
sleep 5                # Wait 5 seconds 
date                   # Current date/time
```

---

## 13. Useful Commands in Scripts

|Command|Use|
|---|---|
|`basename`|Get filename from path|
|`dirname`|Get directory from path|
|`cut`|Extract parts of lines|
|`awk`|Advanced text processing|
|`sed`|Stream editor (replace text)|
|`grep`|Search pattern in text|
|`head`, `tail`|Start/end of file|

---

## 14. Arrays

```bash
arr=(one two three) 
echo ${arr[0]}         # one 
echo ${arr[@]}         # all 
echo ${#arr[@]}        # length  
arr+=(four)            # append
```

---

## 15. Loops with Arrays

```bash
for item in "${arr[@]}"; do     
	echo $item done
```


---

## 16. File and Directory Operations

```bash
mkdir new_folder 
touch file.txt 
rm file.txt 
rm -r folder/ 
mv a.txt b.txt 
cp a.txt b.txt
```

---

## 17. Cron Jobs (Automate Scripts)

Edit crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Example: Run every day at 9 AM

`0 9 * * * /path/to/script.sh`

---

## 18. Real Script Examples

###  Backup Script

```
#!/bin/bash 
tar -czf backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz /home/user
```

### Batch Rename `.txt` to `.bak`

```bash
for file in *.txt; do     
	mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.bak" 
	done
```

---

## 19. Exit Codes

```bash
exit 0      # success 
exit 1      # error
```

Check exit code:

```bash
echo $?
```

---

## 20. Include Other Scripts

```bash
source other_script.sh . other_script.sh
```

---

##  Tips

- Use `#!/bin/bash` at the top.
- Quote variables: `"$var"` to prevent word splitting.
- Always test your script with `bash -x script.sh` for debug.
