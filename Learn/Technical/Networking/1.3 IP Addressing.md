# 🔥 **1.3 — IP Addressing (Hacker / Pentest Notes)**

IP addressing = the **foundation of all networking & hacking**.  
If you understand IP structure, you understand **how devices talk & how to target them**.

---

## 🌐 **What is an IP Address?**

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

`Like a phone number for computers.`

Without an IP, **no communication is possible**.

---

## 🚩 Types of IP Versions

### 🔥 IPv4 (still dominant)

|Property|Value|
|---|---|
|Size|32-bit|
|Format|`A.B.C.D`|
|Example|`192.168.1.9`|
|Total addresses|~4.29 Billion|

### ⚡ IPv6 (future)

|Property|Value|
|---|---|
|Size|128-bit|
|Format|8 groups of hex separated by `:`|
|Example|`2401:db8:abcd:0000:0000:8a2e:370:7334`|
|Total addresses|❗ 340 Undecillion (never-ending)|

---

## 🧠 How IPv4 is Structured (Core Concept)

An IPv4 address has **two parts**:

`[ Network ID ] + [ Host ID ]`

Example:  
`192.168.1.5 / 24`

|Component|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Network portion|`192.168.1`|
|Host portion|`5`|

📌 Devices in the same **Network ID** can communicate **directly**.  
📌 Different networks require **routing** (router involvement).

## 🔐 Public vs Private IP Addresses

### 🔹 Private IP (LAN)

Used **inside homes / offices / internal networks**

|Range|Notes|
|---|---|
|10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255|Large private networks|
|172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255|Medium networks|
|192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255|Home WiFi networks|

Private IP example:  
`192.168.0.12`

❗ Not accessible from the internet.

---

### 🔹 Public IP (WAN)

Used on the **internet**  
Example:  
`103.27.144.83`

🔑 **This is the IP that gets hacked from outside.**

---

### 💀 Hacker Insight

|Information Leaked|Risk|
|---|---|
|Public IP|Can be scanned/attacked|
|Private IP|Reveals internal structure during recon|

Example: A website leaks logs containing `10.10.50.23`  
→ Hacker now knows **internal network range**, helpful for **pivoting + lateral movement** inside LAN.

---

## 🔥 IP Classes (Old System — Still Important for Understanding)

|Class|Range|Used For|Default Mask|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|0–127|Very large networks|/8|
|B|128–191|Medium networks|/16|
|C|192–223|Small networks|/24|
|D|224–239|Multicast|—|
|E|240–255|Research|—|

Modern networks don’t strictly follow Class A/B/C — instead they use **CIDR**.

---

## 📌 CIDR — Classless Inter-Domain Routing

CIDR determines **how many bits belong to the Network ID**.

Example:  
`192.168.1.5 / 26`

`/26 → first 26 bits = network remaining 6 bits = host`

Breakdown:

|Info|Value|
|---|---|
|Network|192.168.1.0|
|Broadcast|192.168.1.63|
|Available Hosts|62|

### Hacker Use Case

- Helps calculate attack surface
- Helps predict internal IP range
- Helps build subnetwork maps

## 🕵️ IP Addressing from the Hacker POV

|Goal|Technique|
|---|---|
|Discover Public IP|`curl ifconfig.me`, Shodan|
|Find Private IP|ARP scan, WiFi sniffing|
|Scan Hosts|`nmap 192.168.1.0/24`|
|Scan Entire Org|CIDR scan from ASN lookup|
|Pivot inside LAN|Use leaked private IP ranges|

Example Pentester Workflow:

```
1. Identify org public IP range (/20, /22 etc.) 
2. Scan every host for open services 
3. Compromise a machine → gain internal access 
4. Enumerate private IP ranges (10.x.x.x etc.) 
5. Pivot deeper into the network
```

## ⚠️ Common IP-Based Attacks

|Attack|Target|
|---|---|
|Port scanning|Public IP|
|ICMP flooding|IP Layer|
|IP spoofing|Transport layer trust exploits|
|DNS rebinding|Private → Public cross-access|
|VPN split tunneling abuse|Internal network exposure|

---

## 🧠 Quick Memory Notes

|Topic|Remember|
|---|---|
|IPv4|0–255 dotted decimal, 32-bit|
|IPv6|Hexadecimal, 128-bit, IPSec built-in|
|Public IP|Attack target|
|Private IP|Pivot target once inside|
|CIDR|Defines network + host calculations|

## 🎯 Micro Summary

```
If you know how an IP is structured →   
you know how networks are structured. 
If you know how networks are structured →   
you know how to attack them.
