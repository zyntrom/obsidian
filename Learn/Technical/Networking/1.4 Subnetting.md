# 🔥 **1.4 — Subnetting (Notes for Hackers & Network Engineers)**

> Subnetting = breaking one large network into multiple smaller logical networks.

It tells you **how many hosts exist**, **how many subnets exist**, and **which IP ranges belong to each subnet**.

For a hacker, subnetting = **mapping attack surface**.

---

## 🧠 Why Subnetting Exists

Without subnetting:  
All devices would be on the **same broadcast domain** → slow, insecure, unmanageable.

### Subnetting solves:

|Benefit|How|
|---|---|
|Performance|Less traffic congestion|
|Security|Breaches stay in one segment|
|Access control|Finance/HR/IoT separated|
|Scalability|Flexible smaller networks|

💀 That’s why **Attackers try to pivot from one subnet to another once they get inside.**

## 🔥 Subnet Mask = defines the network portion of the IP

Examples:

|Subnet Mask|CIDR|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|255.0.0.0|/8|Large networks|
|255.255.0.0|/16|Medium|
|255.255.255.0|/24|Small|
|255.255.255.128|/25|Very small|

📌 **The bigger the subnet mask → the fewer available hosts.**

---

## 📌 Host Calculation Formula

`Number of hosts = 2^(32 – subnet bits) – 2`

(-2 because first = Network ID, last = Broadcast ID)

Example: `/26`

`Hosts = 2^(32 – 26) – 2 = 2^6 – 2 = 64 – 2 = 62 hosts`

---

## 📌 Subnet Count & Block Size

`Block size = 256 – last octet of mask`

Example: `/27` → mask = `255.255.255.224`

`Block = 256 – 224 = 32`

So each subnet has **32 IPs**, including:

- first = network ID
- last = broadcast
- usable = 30

---

## 🚀 Full Example: `10.0.0.0/27`

|Field|Result|
|---|---|
|Hosts|30 usable|
|Block Size|32|
|Subnets in /24 space|256 / 32 = 8 subnets|

Subnets are:

|Subnet|Range|Usable Hosts|Broadcast|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|10.0.0.0 – 10.0.0.31|.1 – .30|10.0.0.31|
|2|10.0.0.32 – 10.0.0.63|.33 – .62|10.0.0.63|
|3|10.0.0.64 – 10.0.0.95|.65 – .94|10.0.0.95|
|...|...|...|...|

## ⚡ Fast “No Math” Subnetting Cheatsheet

|CIDR|Usable Hosts|
|---|---|
|/30|2 hosts|
|/29|6 hosts|
|/28|14 hosts|
|/27|30 hosts|
|/26|62 hosts|
|/25|126 hosts|
|/24|254 hosts|
|/23|510 hosts|
|/22|1022 hosts|
|/16|65,534 hosts|

🔥 Memorize `/24 = 254 hosts`.  
Everything else falls into place quickly.

## 🕵️ **Subnetting for Hackers**

|Subnet|Attack Value|
|---|---|
|/30|Point-to-point links|
|/24|Office network|
|/22 & /23|Large orgs|
|/16|Huge enterprise|

### Scanning Strategy (pentest speed optimization)

|Subnet|Recommended Scan|
|---|---|
|/24|Full Nmap scan OK|
|/23 or /22|Ping sweep → top 100 ports|
|/16|Masscan first → Nmap confirm targets|

Example command combo:

`nmap -sn 10.10.0.0/16 -oG alive.txt nmap -Pn -iL alive.txt -p 1-1000 -T4 -oN results.txt`

## 🪄 Subnetting Trick for Interviews & Exams

Ask yourself:

`How many 1s in subnet mask? = network bits How many 0s in subnet mask? = host bits`

Example:

`/26 → 26 ones, 6 zeros 2^6 = 64 IP addresses 64 – 2 = 62 usable hosts`

Works instantly.

## 💀 Real Pentesting Scenario

You compromise an internal machine → get route info:

`10.10.0.0/16 172.16.50.0/24 192.168.200.0/22`

Your decisions:

|Subnet|Strategy|
|---|---|
|/16|Only ping sweep before scanning|
|/24|Full safe Nmap scan|
|/22|Fast scan of top ports first|

Subnetting tells you **how to plan lateral movement and time usage efficiently**.

## 🎯 Final Quick Memory

`Subnet mask defines network size Smaller subnet = fewer hosts = safer network Larger subnet = more hosts = bigger attack surface`

✔ `/24` = 254 hosts  
✔ `/16` = 65,534 hosts  
✔ `/26` = 62 hosts

If you know subnetting → you can **navigate & attack networks like a pro**.
